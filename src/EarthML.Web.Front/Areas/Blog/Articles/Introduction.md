# Introducing EarthML

The vision at EarthML is that we can make machine learning and earth observation usefull to the common user. 
In the process of doing so we will be blogging, sharing and helping others to do the same. We believe in a open and transparency profile. 
By doing so we will share our current challenges for others to learn from and to get feedback from the community to help solve these challenges.
